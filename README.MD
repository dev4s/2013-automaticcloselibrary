# (~2013) Automatic close library

Custom control written for my "old" freelancing purposes. Mainly - to allow client to test written app for him, for specific amount of time. After that time - app will close automaticly. It allowed me to be 90% sure that client will pay for my hard work :) It's a drag'n'drop control :)
